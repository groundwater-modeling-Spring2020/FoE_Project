# Final Project Repo
This is your group's space feel free to use it however you would like. Add notes to this readme and add any additional folders you would like. Please just keep the Submission folders the same and use those for submitting your assignments as that is the only part of the repo I will be reviewing.

### FOE POSSIBLE COLLABORATION POLICY:
- We each create separate notebooks for each part of the assignment and copy and past from eachother into our individual working notebook
  - this will hopefully prevent weird merge conflicts.  Hopefully.

- At the beginning of ever work session, remember to pull your repository so locally you were up to date!

- At the end of ever work session, remember to push your repository so everyone can be up to date!

- Try to avoid the deleting of files.  Make copies where you can for testing purposes.  A fully fleshed out python3 notebook HW assignment has been averaging about 200 MB or about 0.2 GB.  This includes all files and objects created by running MODFLOW.  Not to shabby!



### IDEAS FOR WORKFLOW
- Ben's folders have one notebook create for each senario.  Helps him keep track of his ".hds" and other files.  If he wants an exact copy of a Python Notebook he moves to his local file explore and makes a copy to commit.  File explore is a great way to keep track of all your files.  Feel free to add ideas below.
